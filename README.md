Hi, this is a study method for the angular framework, i'm following all the concepts, since the fundamentals, authentication, routes, modules
and every single feature that angular provide us (not all, but almost). I'm following a course from Alura, that consists in 4 steps, each of them
is a course, with 10/12 hours, more n less.


Here we use the interface to autocomplete and gain productivity in our process

Using authentication based in our back-end that follows the JWT pattern

Formgroups for the validations of the forms

Using router-outlets to load each component based on the url

Working with RxJS provide us, like, tap, debounceTime, Subject, Observables etc...

Implementing the lazyloading for a better performance


This is a bit that i remembered, so if you trying to hire me, i guess i'll do it.
